## Optical disk drive

- uses a laser light to read data from the disk or write data to the disk
  - the laser has a specific wavelength near or within the visible spectrum
    - CDs (compact disks) - 780nm (infrared)
    - DVDs (digital video disks) - 650nm (red)
    - Blu-ray - 405nm (violet)
- Drives that can read multiple types of disks contain multiple lasers 
- The laser is guided by a lens 
  - DVD and CD share the same lens
  - Drives that can read DVD/CD and Blu-ray have 2 lens
- The laser is moving on a servo
- There are photo-diodes in the drive to detect the reflection of the laser from the disc
- The disk rotates using a rotational mechanism
  - The drive adjusts the disks angular velocity depending on how far up the disk the drive is reading to ensure the part of the disk that is being read/written to is always moving at the same speed
  - essential for music and movies to prevent constant playback rate
  - not necessary for other actions such as opening applications the limitation is not needed so drives spin faster allowing for faster data transfer rate
  - There are 2 different drive loading mechanisms
    - Tray loading
      - This is the usually bulky type which slides out a motorised tray on which you place a disk
    - Slot Loading
      - Disk is slid into and out of a slot using motorised rollers



### Compact disk (CD)

- CDs were originally used for music play back
- CD-ROM (compact disk read only memory) was used to distribute software since it was read only
- CD-R (CD record-able) means the CD can only be burned once
- CD-RW (CD ReWritable) the CD can be written to and read multiple time (existing data can be rewritten unlike CD-R)
- The maximum storage for a CD is around 700MB



### Digital Versatile Disk

- DVD-ROM (read only)
- DVD-R (user can write to certain areas once)
- DVD-RW (the data can be rewritten multiple times unlike DVD-R)



## Structure of a disk

- Disk is 3 layers (Readable part facing down)
  - Layer 1 (bottom): Plastic disk part of the bottom
    - protective layer
  - Layer 2 (middle): Reflective surface
    - Contains the data
  - Layer 3 (top): Disk decoration/label
    - used as a label to identify the disk

### How does the disk hold data

- The disk is made of a poly-carbonate layer with spiral tracks on the top 
- The data is stored as a series of grooves on the CD
  - The grooves are known as pits
  - The space between the pits is the land
  - 1 is represented by no change between the state of pit or land
  - 0 is represented as a change
  - This is done because it requires less changes to encode the same amount of data
- Burning data
  - Burning means creating a pattern of pits and lands
