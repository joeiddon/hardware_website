<h1>Optical disk drive</h1>
<ul>
<li>uses a laser light to read data from the disk or write data to the disk
<ul>
<li>the laser has a specific wavelength near or within the visible spectrum
<ul>
<li>CDs (compact disks) - 780nm (infrared)</li>
<li>DVDs (digital video disks) - 650nm (red)</li>
<li>Blu-ray - 405nm (violet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drives that can read multiple types of disks contain multiple lasers_</li>
<li>The laser is guided by a lens_
<ul>
<li>DVD and CD share the same lens</li>
<li>Drives that can read DVD/CD and Blu-ray have 2 lens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The laser is moving on a servo</li>
<li>There are photo-diodes in the drive to detect the reflection of the laser from the disc</li>
<li>The disk rotates using a rotational mechanism
<ul>
<li>The drive adjusts the disks angular velocity depending on how far up the disk the drive is reading to ensure the part of the disk that is being read/written to is always moving at the same speed</li>
<li>essential for music and movies to prevent constant playback rate</li>
<li>not necessary for other actions such as opening applications the limitation is not needed so drives spin faster allowing for faster data transfer rate</li>
<li>There are 2 different drive loading mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Tray loading
<ul>
<li>This is the usually bulky type which slides out a motorised tray on which you place a disk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slot Loading
<ul>
<li>Disk is slid into and out of a slot using motorised rollers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compact disk (CD)</h3>
<ul>
<li>CDs were originally used for music play back</li>
<li>CD-ROM (compact disk read only memory) was used to distribute software since it was read only</li>
<li>CD-R (CD record-able) means the CD can only be burned once</li>
<li>CD-RW (CD ReWritable) the CD can be written to and read multiple time (existing data can be rewritten unlike CD-R)</li>
<li>The maximum storage for a CD is around 700MB</li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital Versatile Disk</h3>
<ul>
<li>DVD-ROM (read only)</li>
<li>DVD-R (user can write to certain areas once)</li>
<li>DVD-RW (the data can be rewritten multiple times unlike DVD-R)</li>
</ul>
